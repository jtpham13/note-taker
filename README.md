# note-taker

## Description 
This is a web application that was made to help create notes and reminders. This is alot more organized and efficent then having to write reminders down on a piece of paper. This is application you are able to delete the notes and reminders when you have completed the task. This helped me use express.js for the first time in an assigment along with further my skills with html ,css, and javscript.

In the terminal run npm init -y and nmp i express.
